# Unity Template

:construction: Work in Progress :construction:

Unity is a great way to get into game development, but as a .NET developer, it's unconventional "C# as a scripting language" workflow has always bothered me. Where's my project and package references? How do I properly reuse code between projects? Etc etc.

Time to change that. This is my attempt at getting a more normal workflow together for developing a Unity game, from the perspective of the rest of the .NET world.
